<h1
id="the-improvements-of-the-situation-of-chinas-higher-education">The
improvements of “the situation of China’s higher education”</h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In the process of making a visualization of a given dataset, there
would be a lot of elements that need to take in to consideration. For
the user, when reading a visualization, the image can express the
relationship between data clearly and accurately, so that the user will
not feel confused and upset at the first sight of the visualization, not
damaging the structure of the data itself at the same time. Then this
visualization can be said to be relatively successful.</p>
<p>In this project, our team selected the story about the situation of
Chinese higher education. We used a visualization published by Xinhua
News Agency and transformed it into a more readable version. However, it
should be noted that the original image is not actually a “failed”
visualization, because in its original version, the original image
focusing more on decorating the article, that is, it pays more attention
to the beauty of the image. The result is that the readability is
reduced. For the reader, the first impression of this chart will be the
chart itself rather than the data it reflects.</p>
<p>Of course, after our simple transformation, this visualization
becomes easier to read. In the process of information visualization for
academic purposes, what we focusing on has to be the readability of the
visualization. Through such comparison, what we want to illustrate is
the importance of information visualization skills in academic
papers.</p>
<p>We will first describe the story expressed in the graph, then our
improvement, and finally we will summarize the entire report.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-of-the-graph">The story of the graph</h2>
<p>September is the back-to-school season for Chinese colleges and
universities. Many Chinese young people go to the campus of colleges and
universities. China’s institutions of higher education have produced
generations of promising young Chinese people who have devoted
themselves to all walks of life in China’s development.</p>
<p>The spectacular development of China’s modern higher education can be
traced back to October 2, 1895, when the predecessor of Tianjin
University, Imperial Tientsin University, was born in Tianjin.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the People’s Republic of China, there were only
205 general colleges and universities in China. After decades of
development, especially after the Chinese general colleges and
universities began enrollment expansion in 1999, the number of general
colleges and universities, the number of students, the number of
graduates and the size of schools have all exploded.</p>
<p>In order to understand the specific information, We found a graph:
(http://www.news.cn/datanews/20211015/C999058529900001C39214B0FE601D68/20211015C999058529900001C39214B0FE601D68_1211351537_1630390571638_title.jpg)
However, when reviewing the data of the graph, our team found a lot of
inadequacies in the visualization of the graph. <img
src="./images/orgE.jpg" /> On the X-axis is the year information, from
1997 to 2020. The Y-axis is divided into the left and right sides, the
left side represents the number of schools. On the right, indicates the
number of teachers and students. The unit is ten thousand. The Y-axis on
the left corresponds to the dark blue broken line in the graph, which
represents the number of general colleges and universities; The Y-axis
on the right corresponds to the two scatter points in the graph. The
blue scatter points indicates the number of students in general colleges
and universities, and the brown scatter points indicates the number of
full-time teachers in general colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The data looks neat, but it actually has some shortcomings in
visualization. First, our team found that the relative length of its
X-axis was short, which made the X-axis coordinates representing the
year vertical and not convenient for us to observe. Secondly, when the
scatter points represent the number of people, the change trend is not
particularly intuitive, and the scatter points are too large for us to
directly observe the specific data of the number of people in different
years. Finally, the origin’s height of the Y-axis coordinates on both
sides is different, the coordinate interval of the left Y-axis is too
large (the coordinates of 6K~14K even have no effect), and the
coordinate on the right is not guided by a straight line, which is not
convenient for data observation.</p>
<p>In response to these problems, our team decided to improve the
visualization graph. This graph shows the trend of China’s modern higher
education (1997-2020) from elitism to popularization and then to
popularization. China becomes one of the largest countries of higher
education in the world. It is an important graph material for
understanding and studying the development of China’s modern higher
education. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the graph.
## Improvements</p>
<p>To improve this visualization, first we need to restore it in to a
vector diagram. We used matplotlib to do this. Here is the diagram we
restored. We output it in a .svg format. We put the original image aside
for comparison. <img src="./images/org.jpg" /><img
src="./images/org.svg" /></p>
<p>You may find that the data size in the graph is slightly different,
because we actually do not have the original dataset, but fabricate a
set of approximate datasets for use. This is because there is no
specific data set in the original text, so we have to use the data we
made up. But this is not the key point. We want to show the improvement
of this chart, not the real data.</p>
<p>In the previous context, we mentioned three shortages of the original
visualization. The first is the usage of the two y-axes. The two y-axes
of one on the left and one on the right interfere with the resolution of
units. The solution is also simple: divide this plot into two subplots.
One plot is used to describe the data of the left y-axis: the number of
universities, and one plot is used to describe the data of the right
y-axis: the number of tutors and students.</p>
<p>Second, the plot type used is a scatter plot. Although it can roughly
show the trend of data changes, it cannot show the size of data accurate
enough. Here, we choose the line plot cooperating with nodes for data
visualization. On the one hand, it can show the growth of data more
clearly, on the other hand, it can show the size of data more
accurately. At the same time, we will unify the legend and use different
colors to distinguish different data.</p>
<p>Finally, the width of the x-axis is too narrow. We lengthen the
horizontal axis so that the plot can output all the years horizontally
without overlapping. Here is our final finished picture. <img
src="./images/changed.svg" /></p>
<p>This is the final version of our improvement of the original plot.
Comparing it with the original plot, and you will find that it is more
intuitive for data presentation. You can see the growth of the data
clearly and obtain the size of the data accurately. Compared with the
original plot, it is much cleaner. ## Summary</p>
<p>Overall, we stated the reason for choosing this visualization, the
story of visualization and the improvement of visualization. I believe
you have got a preliminary impression of information visualization
technics. In the process of data processing and presentation,
information visualization skills for practical purposes can make data
presentation cleaner and more efficient. Readers can easily obtain the
required information and stories from the visualization, so that they
can have a deeper understanding of the dataset displayed.</p>
