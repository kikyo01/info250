    ## Project 1
    
    ##### About The project
    
    During the time, As the person in charge of the project, Song Chi was responsible for the coordination and task allocation of the whole team. At the same time, he and Yiwei Han together completed the code work of the first three problems. And Xurui Zhang and Yu Gui were responsible for the writing of the last two problems. In the process of coding, we helped each other, learned from each other's strengths, and finally successfully completed this project. 
    
    ##### Preparatory Work
    
    In this part, we define a number of functions so that we can use them later.
    
    ##### Task 1
    
    In this part, we choose SVM for visualization. Finally we chose a bar dot plot to show the content. The visualization shows the distribution of the data.
    
    ##### Task 2
    
    To  show how affects energy consumption, we grouped by experiment_id, because when `RQ=2.2`, each feature number corresponds to one experiment_id, and each experiment is performed 30 times. The `xy_egy()` function is grouped by experiment_id, averaged, and then called `plot_bar()` for visualization.
    
    ##### Task 3
    
    To finish this task, we print the algorithms at first. Then we use `xy_egy()` to determine the number of features or samples of each algorithm and transfer it to x and y, and set the number of decimal places of y to 3 Bit (convenient for illustration) and then call the functions plot_bar1 (for `RQ=2.1`) and plot_bar2 to draw `(for RQ=2.2)`ã€‚ In addition, the drawing function calls the muti_axes function, and when the mode is equal to 1 or 2, it will be in a different subgraph.
    
    ##### Task 4
    
    We defined a function named plot_barh(). In plot_barh() We made a division of every no_features values with egy and no_datapoints values with egy. Then we get a average of egy cost rate of every althirom into one horizontal bar chart.
    
    ##### Task 5
    
    We use a scatter plot to show the relationship between 'recall' and 'f1'. By the result of the scatter plot,we can find there would be a positive-relevant relationship between recall and f1.
